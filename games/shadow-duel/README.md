# shadow-duel

A "Simon says" audio game aka ear training.

Gameplay:

1. Enemy duelist makes some sounds (pitches/frequencies) that tell you what attacks they're aboud to make.
2. You have to reply with those pitches in order to block their attacks.
   - If you get them all right, then you rebuff their attacks and then hit them!
3. ?? Should it be a rhythm game (ear trainig + right rhythm) or just call-and-response?
   - Call and response to start! Much simpler to validate user input.
   - Can still have a timer to provide pressure.

Win/Lose condition:

- Lose: Die, by failing to block
- Win: Kill the enemy, by successfully blocking and then getting hits in!

Ideas:

- simpler enemies -- just one call and response to kill them. then you move forward / climb
- bosses - different kinds of
- start with small pallette of notes and then grow
- story: why are you fighting? Maybe you are losing your sense of sound and you need to recover it. An evildoer has stolen sounds and hidden them in his castle, and you have to battle to get the sounds back!
- on a controller.. what if up/left/down are defense and right is attack? hitting the notes (up/left/down) is to defenend, and then you can stab back during the rests (right).

How to emphasize _frequency_?

- audio visualizer:
  - middle of screen is shadow duel, but in background or as a bar across the upper part of the screen, visualize the waveform of the current pitch.
- frequency could also have to do with _speed_ at which notes come at your. Low frequency means "long interval between the notes".
