## Game Logic

- [ ] add three sounds for diff attack types
- [ ] play the sounds in a simple rhythm (e.g. where Q is quarter and (r) is rest)
    - Q (r) Q Q Q 
- [ ] have player input the keys in that order
- [ ] hit or miss
    - if correct, say hit! - enemy takes damage
    - if incorrect, say miss! - take damage
- [ ] show health number for hero and enemy

## Sound Improvements

- [ ] have a backing song / rhythm that the enemy attacks play over, in sync. thus it makes more sense

Gameplay:

1. Enemy duelist makes some sounds (pitches/frequencies) that tell you what attacks they're aboud to make.
2. You have to reply with those pitches in order to block their attacks.
   - If you get them all right, then you rebuff their attacks and then hit them!
3. ?? Should it be a rhythm game (ear trainig + right rhythm) or just call-and-response?
   - Call and response to start! Much simpler to validate user input.
   - Can still have a timer to provide pressure.
